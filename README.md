# NC_News

## You can access the live demo of the project [here](https://nc-news-fe-jessjelly.netlify.app/).

This project enhances the usability of Northcoders News using React, a popular web development tool. Users can conveniently access articles, leave comments, and vote on content. The app connects to the [Northcoders News server](https://github.com/ksskol/NC_News_BE) to fetch all necessary information. Articles are neatly listed, clickable for reading, voting, and commenting. Logged-in users can add or delete comments.

Here is the [LInk](https://github.com/ksskol/NC_News_BE) to the backend repository.

**Note:** At the moment, users are registered as 'jessjelly' upon accessing the website. Future updates will include an option to register as different users.
